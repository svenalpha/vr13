had this message in render log when deploying: 
" Poetry (1.7.1) is installed now. Great!
To get started you need Poetry's bin directory (/opt/render/project/poetry/bin) in your `PATH`
environment variable.
Add `export PATH="/opt/render/project/poetry/bin:$PATH"` to your shell configuration file.
Alternatively, you can call Poetry explicitly with `/opt/render/project/poetry/bin/poetry`.
You can test that everything is set up by executing:
`poetry --version` "
